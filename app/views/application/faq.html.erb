  <h1>The GovBuy experiment</h1>

  <p>GovBuy is a Government Digital Services initiative that helps government employees buy microservices (small pieces of software that can be deployed independently), software libraries, non-critical bug fixes or even customised hardware from independent contractors.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>The platform allows government employees to post a task or project. Anyone can bid to take on the project during the bidding period. The reverse auction starts at $5,000 and the lowest bid wins.</p>
  <p>The winner works on the project and submits their code to the team. If the code meets the acceptance criteria before the deadline, they are sent a cheque for their work.</p>
  <p>The current site is a prototype that we are trialling with NUS Computing students to gauge interest and feasibility.</p>
